# Tire Data Analysis - Cornering

This project centers around the analysis of tire data collected during cornering tests for seven different tires. The analysis includes plotting normalized saturated Fy vs. Fz, and plotting corner stiffness vs. Fz under two distinct pressure conditions.

- Fit Lateral Force vs. Slip Angle curves

- Calculate saturated lateral force

- Calculate corner stiffness

- Create informative plots
